Folders/Files:

-/UCI HAR Dataset      -> Contains the unzipped raw data
-Codebook.md           -> Contains the description of the source and all steps
-Data.zip              -> Contains the zipped raw data
-FinalData.txt         -> Contains the final data set
-README.Rmd            -> Conatins this README file outlineing the folder and files
-WearableData.Rproject -> Contains the R Studio project packaging all these files
-run_analysis.R        -> Contains source code with comments
